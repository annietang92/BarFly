B&B	Brandy or cognac	N	Brandy	Straight up; without ice or on the rocks	 Brandy snifter	1 oz Benedictine, 1 oz brandy	Pour the Benedictine into a brandy snifter. Use the back of a bar spoon to gently float the brandy on top.	B&B stands for Brandy & Benedictine. It is one of the icons of fine drinking and is a true classic cocktail. Often, a B&B is served on the rocks, although some prefer it straight up and other prefer it slightly warmer (prep your snifter with warm water, dumping it before adding the spirits). It is almost always served in a brandy snifter and this also makes an ideal after dinner drink or nightcap.	http://cdn3.foodviva.com/static-content/food-images/cocktail-recipes/b-b-benedictine-brandy-cocktail/b-b-benedictine-brandy-cocktail.jpg	6
Rusty Nail	Whiskey	Y	Whiskey	On the rocks; poured over ice	old-fashioned glass, stemmed glass	45ml (9 parts) Scotch Whisky, 25ml (5 parts) Drambuie	First fill a 16 oz glass with crushed ice until it is overflowing. Pour in 5 parts drambuie and 9 parts scotch. Stir gently, as to not bruise the ice. Keep stirring until a thick frost develops on the side of the glass. Garnish with a lemon twist. Serve.	A Rusty Nail is made by mixing Drambuie and Scotch whisky. The drink was included in Difford's Guide Top 100 Cocktails. Some prefer less Drambuie to decrease the sweetness of the drink. Scotch whisky has a fairly biting and hot taste that is counterbalanced by the honeyed, herbal overtones of the Drambuie. A Rusty Nail can be served in an old-fashioned glass on the rocks, neat, or "up" in a stemmed glass. It is most commonly served over ice. A Rusty Nail served without ice is sometimes called a Straight Up Nail.	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vjLjvmqdwJ8/Tdb5XwNyltI/AAAAAAAAApM/T98k6eCR31w/s1600/Gaslight%2B01.jpg	16

Sake Bomb	Beer	N	Beer, Sake	Straight up; without ice	A pub glass and a shot glass	1 pint (~14 parts) beer, 1 shot (1 part) Sake	The shot of sake is dropped into the beer, causing it to fizz violently. The drink should then be consumed immediately.	The sake bomb or sake bomber is a beer cocktail made by pouring sake into a shot glass and dropping it into a glass of beer. Sometimes two chopsticks are placed parallel on top of the glass of beer, and the shot glass is carefully balanced between them. The drinker slams the table with his fists, causing the sake to fall into the beer. It should be drunk immediately, and works best with warm sake. Alternatively, the drinker may count to three in Japanese, "ichi...ni...san...SAKE BOMB!" Or he may simply yell "KANPAI!" A variation of the sake bomb is to "bomb" a shot of warm sake into chilled Red Bull energy drink.	http://kunights.com/images/6/media/2011/07/07/sake_bomb.jpg	10

A Flaming Doctor Pepper is a flaming cocktail said to taste like the soft drink Dr Pepper, although Dr Pepper is not one of its ingredients. It is usually made by filling a shot glass with 3 parts Amaretto and 1 part high-proof liquor, such as Everclear or Bacardi 151. The two liquors are not mixed; the high-proof alcohol is layered on top of the Amaretto. The shot is then set on fire and dropped into a glass half-filled with beer. The flames are extinguished by the beer, and the cocktail should then be drunk quickly.	http://www.mutineermagazine.com/img/blog/flaming_dr_pepper.jpg	20

Death in the Afternoon, also called the Hemingway or the Hemingway Champagne, is a cocktail made up of absinthe and Champagne invented by Ernest Hemingway. The cocktail shares a name with Hemingway's book Death in the Afternoon, and the recipe published in So Red the Nose, or Breath in the Afternoon, 1935 cocktail book with contributions from famous authors. Hemingway's original instructions were: "Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly."	http://media.cocktailia.com/2009/11/death-in-the-afternoon-480x640.jpg	1
Black Velvet	Beer	N	Beer, Champaign	Straight up; without ice	Champagne flute	beer and sparkling wine or champagne	A Black Velvet is made by filling a vessel, traditionally a tall champagne flute, halfway with sparkling wine and floating the chilled stout beer on top of the wine. The differing densities of the liquids cause them to remain largely in separate layers (as in a pousse-café). The effect is best achieved by pouring over a spoon turned upside down over the top of the glass so that the liquid runs gently down the sides rather than splashing into the lower layer and mixing with it.	The Black Velvet is a beer cocktail made from stout beer (often Guinness) and white, sparkling wine, traditionally champagne. The drink was first created by the bartender of Brooks's Club in London in 1861, to mourn the death of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's Prince Consort. It is supposed to symbolise the black or purple cloth armbands worn by mourners.	http://img4-3.myrecipes.timeinc.net/i/recipes/sl/07/10/black-velvet-sl-1662857-x.jpg	6

Traditionally, a mojito is a cocktail that consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, sparkling water, and mint. The original Cuban recipe uses spearmint or yerba buena, a mint variety very popular on the island. Its combination of sweetness, refreshing citrus, and mint flavors is intended to complement the potent kick of the rum, and have made this clear highball a popular summer drink. The cocktail has a relatively low alcohol content (about 10 percent alcohol by volume).	http://www.cbc.ca/stevenandchris/content/images/42_mojito.jpg	32

Planter's Punch	Rum	Y	Rum	On the rocks; poured over ice	Highball Glass	4.5cl Dark rum, 3.5cl Fresh orange juice, 3.5cl Fresh pineapple juice, 2cl Fresh lemon juice, 1cl Grenadine syrup, 1cl Sugar syrup, 3 or 4 dashes Angostura bitters	Pour all ingredients, except the bitters, into shaker filled with ice.

The cocktail has been said to have originated at the Planters Hotel in Charleston, SC, but the recipe originates in Jamaica. The September 1878 issue of the London magazine Fun listed the recipe as follows: "A wine-glass with lemon juice fill, of sugar the same glass fill twice / Then rub them together until / The mixture looks smooth, soft, and nice. / Of rum then three wine glasses add, / And four of cold water please take. A Drink then you'll have that's not bad — / At least, so they say in Jamaica."	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Planters_Punch_2.jpg	22

Add the grenadine, which will sink to the bottom. Do not stir. Garnish and serve.	The Tequila Sunrise is a cocktail made in two different ways, the original (tequila, crème de cassis, lime juice and soda water) and the more popular concoction (tequila, orange juice, and grenadine syrup). Originally served at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel, where it was created by Gene Sulit in the 1930s or 1940s, the cocktail is named for the way it looks after it has been poured into a glass. The denser ingredients (cassis or grenadine) settle, creating gradations in color that mimic a sunrise. The more popular version was invented by Bobby Lazoff and Billy Rice at the Trident restaurant in Sausalito, California in the early 1970s.	http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zn2CJJW9I2c/Ufwy7DMmpFI/AAAAAAAAIdE/bmWi7uxnkuo/s1600/DSC_0116.JPG	41
